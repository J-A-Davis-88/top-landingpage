# The Odin Project - Landing Page project

This project focused on styling with CSS and positioning content using the box model or flexbox properties.

A model was given to follow with a photo of the design and a template for colors and fonts. Those images are below....

The page was styled using only CSS. It was not made responsive for smaller screens, as the project only focused on replicating the model page, not responsiveness.
